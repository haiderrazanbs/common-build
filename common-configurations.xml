	<!--
		Provided dependencies are those that the container or normal runtime
		system will be providing but for now, we need some jars to replace
		them. API only jars may be in here as well as other container based
		jars. Example: The J2EE API jars may be provided for SUN for
		compilation but should not be deployed to JBOSS since JBOSS provides
		its own versions.

	<!--
		Compile dependencies are those that system needs to compile the
		application/library Compile dependencies are the set of 'core' and
		'provided' dependencies and any other the user designates. Example:
		The user may have the commons-collection as a 'core' dependency, the
		Java Persistence API as a 'provided' dependency and a sepcific
		implementation of the JPA as needed for 'compile'.

	<!--
		Deploy dependencies are those runtime dependencies that the build
		system needs to deploy with the application but are not needed for
		testing or compile. Example: The HSQLDB (Database and JDBC Drivers)
		jars may be used for testing but the application will need to deploy
		the Microsoft and Oracle database drivers. So the 'test' dependency
		would be HSQLDB and the 'deploy' dependency will be microsoft and
		oracle jdbc drivers.

	<!--
		Test dependencies are those runtime dependencies that the build system
		needs to test the application but are not needed for compilation.
		Example: The HSQLDB (Database and JDBC Drivers) jars may be used for
		testing but the application will need to deploy the Microsoft and
		Oracle database drivers. So the 'test' dependency would be HSQLDB and
		the 'deploy' dependency will be microsoft and oracle jdbc drivers.
